# What is a Growth Mindset

To have a **growth mindset**, it means that you are willing to step out of your <em>comfort zone</em>.
It is the idea that even though you don't know something about a topic, that doesn't mean that you can't learn about the topic. 
If you go into a topic without any knowledge, even if you end up failing, you can pick yourself back up and learn from your failings and mistakes, and realize that those mistakes were an important part of the learning process. 

## Reminders of How to stay in a growth mindset

1. **Mistakes** are <em>important</em> and <em>essential</em> to the learning process
2. Give your mind **breaks**, let the information digest, don't forget to <em>ask for help</em>
3. Stay diligent and **keep trying**, remember that <em>google</em> is a great friend
